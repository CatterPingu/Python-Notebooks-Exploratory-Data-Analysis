# Python-Notebooks-Exploratory-Data-Analysis

This repository contains four Jupyter notebooks that demonstrate the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) process using Python. The four datasets used in these notebooks are:

1. Black Friday Dataset
2. Flight Price Dataset
3. Zomato Dataset
4. Automated EDA

## Dataset Descriptions

### Black Friday Dataset
This dataset contains information about sales transactions that occurred on Black Friday at a retail store. It has 12 columns and 7,83,667 rows.

### Flight Price Dataset
This dataset contains information about flight prices and their associated attributes. It has 15 columns and 13,351 rows.

### Zomato Dataset
This dataset contains information about restaurants, their ratings, and other attributes such as location, cuisine, etc. It has 21 columns and 9.5521 rows.

### Automated EDA
This dataset is the default seaborn data tips and titanic.

## Notebooks

1. Black Friday Dataset
The Black Friday Dataset notebook demonstrates EDA techniques such as data cleaning, data visualization, and feature engineering. It also shows how to use various Python libraries such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and seaborn.

2. Flight Price Dataset
The Flight Price Dataset notebook demonstrates EDA techniques such as data cleaning, data visualization, and feature engineering. It also shows how to use various Python libraries such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and seaborn.

3. Zomato Dataset
The Zomato Dataset notebook demonstrates EDA techniques such as data cleaning, data visualization, and feature engineering. It also shows how to use various Python libraries such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and seaborn.

4. Automated EDA
The Automated EDA notebook demonstrates how to use the sweetviz,yData_Profiling and DTale library to generate automated EDA reports. It shows how to generate reports for a single dataset and how to compare multiple datasets.

## Conclusion

Exploratory Data Analysis is an important step in any data science project. These notebooks demonstrate how to perform EDA using Python and various libraries. By following the steps outlined in these notebooks, you can gain insights into your data and make informed decisions about how to proceed with your analysis.
